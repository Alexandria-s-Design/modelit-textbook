    <h2>Opening Hook</h2>
    <p>In 1918, the Spanish Flu killed 50 million people worldwide—more than World War I. Today, scientists can model how diseases spread through populations and predict outbreaks before they happen. Understanding disease as a SYSTEM can save millions of lives.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How Disease Spreads</h2>
    Diseases don't just happen randomly; they follow patterns. <strong>Epidemiology</strong> is the study of how diseases spread through populations.

<h3>Pathogens: The Agents of Disease</h3>

A <strong>pathogen</strong> is any organism that causes disease.

<strong>Main Types:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Virus:</strong> Tiny infectious agents that need a host cell to replicate (e.g., Flu, COVID-19)</li>
  <li><strong>Bacteria:</strong> Single-celled organisms that can live anywhere (e.g., Strep throat, E. coli)</li>
  <li><strong>Fungi & Parasites:</strong> Other organisms that can cause illness</li>
</ul>

<h3>Routes of Transmission</h3>

How does a pathogen get from one person to another?
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direct Contact:</strong> Touching, shaking hands</li>
  <li><strong>Airborne:</strong> Coughing, sneezing (droplets)</li>
  <li><strong>Vector-borne:</strong> Carried by insects like mosquitoes (Malaria)</li>
  <li><strong>Contaminated Food/Water:</strong> Eating unsafe food</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Numbers of Spread: R0</h3>

Scientists use a number called <strong>R0</strong> (pronounced "R-nought") to measure how contagious a disease is.

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>What does R0 mean?</strong>
<br>
R0 represents the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus to.
<ul>
  <li><strong>R0 < 1:</strong> Disease dies out</li>
  <li><strong>R0 = 1:</strong> Disease stays stable (Endemic)</li>
  <li><strong>R0 > 1:</strong> Disease spreads exponentially (<strong>Epidemic</strong>)</li>
</ul>
Measles has an R0 of 12-18, making it one of the most contagious diseases!
</div>

<h3>From Outbreak to Pandemic</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Epidemic:</strong> A sudden increase in cases in a specific area.</li>
  <li><strong>Pandemic:</strong> An epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents.</li>
</ul>

<div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">SIR Model:</strong> A classic model used by epidemiologists:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong>usceptible: People who can get sick</li>
        <li><strong>I</strong>nfected: People currently sick and spreading it</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong>ecovered: People who had it and are now immune</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Immune System</h2>
    Your body has a powerful defense system to fight off pathogens. The <strong>Immune System</strong> is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs.

<h3>Lines of Defense</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Line (Barriers):</strong> Skin, mucus, stomach acid. These stop pathogens from entering.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Line (Innate Immunity):</strong> General response. Fever, inflammation, and white blood cells that attack anything foreign.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Line (Adaptive Immunity):</strong> Targeted response. Your body learns to recognize specific enemies.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Players: Antigens and Antibodies</h3>

How does your body know what to attack?

<ul>
  <li><strong>Antigen:</strong> A marker on the surface of a pathogen (like a flag). Your body recognizes it as "foreign."</li>
  <li><strong>Antibody:</strong> A Y-shaped protein produced by your body that locks onto specific antigens to neutralize them.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Lock and Key</strong>
<br>
Antibodies are specific. An antibody for the flu virus won't work on the chickenpox virus. It's like a key that only opens one lock.
</div>

<h3>White Blood Cells</h3>

These are the soldiers of the immune system. Some "eat" bacteria (macrophages), while others (B-cells and T-cells) coordinate the attack and remember the enemy for next time.
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Vaccines and Public Health</h2>
    We don't just have to wait to get sick. We can prepare our immune systems in advance.

<h3>How Vaccines Work</h3>

A <strong>Vaccine</strong> trains your immune system to recognize a pathogen without making you sick.
<ul>
  <li>It introduces a harmless version or piece of the pathogen (antigen).</li>
  <li>Your body produces antibodies and "memory cells."</li>
  <li>If you encounter the real germ later, your body destroys it instantly. This is <strong>Immunity</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Herd Immunity</h3>

When enough people are immune to a disease, the disease has nowhere to go. This protects people who cannot get vaccinated (like babies or people with weak immune systems).

<div class="vocabulary">
<strong>Herd Immunity Threshold:</strong> The percentage of the population that needs to be immune to stop the spread. For highly contagious diseases like measles, this is over 95%!
</div>

<h3>Public Health Measures</h3>

Besides vaccines, we use other tools to stop spread:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quarantine:</strong> Separating sick people from healthy people.</li>
  <li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Hand washing, sanitation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Real-World Success Story: Smallpox</strong>
<br>
Smallpox was a deadly virus that killed millions. Through a massive global vaccination effort, it was declared <strong>eradicated</strong> in 1980. It is the first human disease to be completely wiped off the Earth!
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Antibiotic Resistance</h2>
    Bacteria are living systems too, and they evolve. This is creating a major problem.

<h3>What are Antibiotics?</h3>

<strong>Antibiotics</strong> are medicines that kill bacteria. They transformed medicine, making once-deadly infections treatable.
<br><em>Note: Antibiotics do NOT work on viruses (colds, flu).</em>

<h3>The Rise of Superbugs</h3>

When we overuse antibiotics or don't finish our medicine, some bacteria survive. These survivors have mutations that make them resistant. They multiply, creating a population of <strong>Resistant</strong> bacteria.

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Evolution in Action</strong>
<br>
<strong>Antibiotic Resistance</strong> is a clear example of natural selection.
<ol>
  <li>Variation exists (some bacteria are naturally tougher).</li>
  <li>Selection pressure (antibiotic kills the weak ones).</li>
  <li>Survival of the fittest (resistant bacteria survive and reproduce).</li>
</ol>
To prevent this, only use antibiotics when prescribed by a doctor!
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Modeling Disease in Cell Collective</h2>
    Epidemiologists use computer models to save lives. You can too!

<h3>Building an SIR Model</h3>

In Cell Collective, you can simulate a population during an outbreak.

<strong>Key Components:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Susceptible Pool:</strong> Healthy people.</li>
  <li><strong>Infected Pool:</strong> Sick people.</li>
  <li><strong>Recovered Pool:</strong> Immune people.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Connections:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Susceptible people become Infected (Transmission Rate).</li>
  <li>Infected people become Recovered (Recovery Rate).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing Strategies</h3>

Once your model is running, try different interventions:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Social Distancing:</strong> Reduces the transmission rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Masks:</strong> Reduces the probability of infection.</li>
  <li><strong>Vaccination:</strong> Moves people directly from Susceptible to Recovered (bypassing infection!).</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Challenge!</strong> create a model where a disease has a high R0 but low death rate (like a cold), and another with low R0 but high death rate (like Ebola). Which one is harder to control?
