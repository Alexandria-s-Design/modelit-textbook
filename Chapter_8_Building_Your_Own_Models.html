</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Opening Hook</h2>
    <p>Scientists don't just run simulations—they BUILD them. Every model you have explored was designed by someone who asked: "How does this system work?" Now it's your turn to be the model builder.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Design Process</h2>
    Building a scientific model is a creative process that requires careful planning. Before you ever touch a computer, you need to understand what you are trying to represent.
    
    <h3>Defining the Question</h3>
    Every good model starts with a question. A clear question helps you decide what is important to include and what can be left out.
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Too broad:</strong> "How does an ecosystem work?"</li>
        <li><strong>Just right:</strong> "How does the number of wolves affect the deer population?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sketching Relationships</h3>
    Once you have your question, grab a piece of paper and sketch it out. Draw circles for the main parts and lines connecting them. This "concept map" is the blueprint for your model.
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Design Tip: Start Simple!</strong>
    Don't try to include everything in the world. Start with the most important parts. You can always add more detail later. This is called <strong>abstraction</strong>—focusing only on the relevant details.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Identifying Components</h2>
    The parts that make up your system are called <strong>components</strong>.
    
    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Component:</strong> A distinct part or element of a larger system. In a computer model, these are often the "nodes" or "agents."
    </div>

    When listing your components, try to categorize them:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Living things:</strong> Animals, plants, bacteria</li>
        <li><strong>Non-living resources:</strong> Water, sunlight, nutrients</li>
        <li><strong>States or Conditions:</strong> Temperature, pH, infection status (healthy vs. sick)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Variable:</strong> A component or factor that can change or vary over time.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Creating Relationships and Interactions</h2>
    Components in a system don't just sit there; they affect each other. These connections are called <strong>interactions</strong> or <strong>relationships</strong>.

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Interaction:</strong> The action or influence of people, groups, or things on one another.
    </div>

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Relationship:</strong> The way in which two or more concepts, objects, or people are connected.
    </div>

    When drawing connections (usually with arrows), ask yourself:
    <ul>
        <li>Does A increase B? (Positive relationship)</li>
        <li>Does A decrease B? (Negative relationship)</li>
        <li>Is the relationship one-way or two-way?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Common Mistake to Avoid:</strong>
    Don't confuse "eating" with "energy flow." If a wolf eats a rabbit, the rabbit population goes DOWN, but the wolf's energy goes UP. Make sure your model arrows represent the correct flow of influence!
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Adding Regulatory Elements</h2>
    Systems are rarely simple straight lines. They have loops and switches that control them. This is called <strong>regulation</strong>.

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Regulation:</strong> The control or maintenance of a process or rate.
    </div>

    <h3>Feedback Loops</h3>
    
    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Positive Feedback:</strong> A process that amplifies or increases change (e.g., population explosion).
    </div>

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Negative Feedback:</strong> A process that counteracts change and maintains stability (e.g., a thermostat maintaining temperature).
    </div>

    <h3>Thresholds and Switches</h3>
    Sometimes a relationship only happens if a certain condition is met. For example, a fire might only start if the temperature is above a certain <strong>threshold</strong>.

    <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Think Like a Scientist:</strong>
    Nature is full of negative feedback loops that keep things balanced (homeostasis). If your model crashes or explodes to infinity instantly, you might be missing a negative feedback loop!
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Testing and Refining Your Model</h2>
    Once you've built your model, you need to see if it works. This process is called <strong>validation</strong>.

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Validation:</strong> The process of checking if a model accurately represents the real system.
    </div>

    <h3>Running Simulations</h3>
    Run your simulation and watch what happens.
    <ul>
        <li>Does the behavior match your expectations?</li>
        <li>Does it match data from the real world?</li>
        <li>If you change a variable, does the outcome make sense?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Hypothesis:</strong> A proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation. Your model is a way to test a hypothesis!
    </div>

    <h3>Iterating</h3>
    Your first model will almost never be perfect. That's okay! Science is about <strong>iteration</strong>.

    <div class="vocabulary">
    <strong class="vocabulary-term">Iteration:</strong> The process of repeating steps to refine and improve a design or model.
    </div>

    If your model doesn't work, go back to the design process. Did you miss a component? Is a relationship backwards? Make changes and test again.
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Sharing Your Work with the Class</h2>
    Science is a collaborative effort. Once you have a working model, you need to communicate your findings.

    <h3>Peer Review</h3>
    Show your model to a classmate. Can they understand it without you explaining every step?
    <ul>
        <li>Explain your question and hypothesis.</li>
        <li>Walk them through your components and relationships.</li>
        <li>Show a simulation run and explain the results.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Communication Tip:</strong>
    Use clear labels and colors. A messy model is hard to understand. Group related components together to make it easier to read.

    <p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 20 minutes</p>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify your goal: Maintain a comfortable room temperature (e.g., 70°F).</li>
        <li><strong>Components:</strong> Room Temperature, Heater, Thermostat Setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong>
