<div class="section">
    <h2>Opening Hook</h2>
    <p>That oxygen atom you just breathed in? It might have been exhaled by a dinosaur 65 million years ago. Matter doesn't disappear—it cycles through Earth's systems endlessly.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Law of Conservation of Matter</h2>
    Everything in the universe is made of <strong>matter</strong>. From the stars in the sky to the cells in your body, it's all stuff that takes up space and has mass.

    <h3>Matter Cannot Be Created or Destroyed</h3>
    The <strong>Law of Conservation of Matter</strong> states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. It can only change form.

    <div class="vocabulary">
        <strong class="vocabulary-term">Conservation:</strong> To save or keep something from being lost or wasted. In science, it means the total amount stays the same.
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Real-World Example: Burning Wood</strong>
        When you burn a log in a fireplace, it seems to disappear. But it doesn't! The wood turns into:
        <ul>
            <li>Ash (solid)</li>
            <li>Smoke (solid particles)</li>
            <li>Gases (carbon dioxide and water vapor)</li>
        </ul>
        If you captured all the smoke, ash, and gases, they would weigh exactly the same as the original log plus the oxygen used to burn it.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Water Cycle</h2>
    Water is constantly moving around the Earth. The same water you drink today has been around for billions of years! This continuous movement is called the <strong>Water Cycle</strong>.

    <h3>Key Processes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into vapor (gas).</li>
        <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Water vapor cools down in the air and turns back into liquid droplets, forming clouds.</li>
        <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> When clouds get heavy, water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</li>
        <li><strong>Transpiration:</strong> Plants release water vapor from their leaves into the air.</li>
        <li><strong>Runoff:</strong> Water flows over the ground into rivers, lakes, and oceans.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Amazing Fact:</strong>
        Less than 1% of Earth's water is available for humans to drink! Most of it is salty ocean water (97%) or frozen in glaciers (2%).
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Carbon Cycle</h2>
    Carbon is the building block of life. It's in every living thing! The <strong>Carbon Cycle</strong> describes how carbon moves between living things and the environment.

    <h3>How Carbon Moves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> Plants take in carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air to make food.</li>
        <li><strong>Respiration:</strong> Animals (and plants!) release CO₂ back into the air when they breathe and use energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> When living things die, decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break them down, releasing carbon back into the soil and air.</li>
        <li><strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong> Over millions of years, buried plants and animals turn into coal, oil, and natural gas. Burning them releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="vocabulary">
        <strong class="vocabulary-term">Reservoir:</strong> A place where matter is stored for a long time. Examples: The ocean, the atmosphere, and forests are carbon reservoirs.
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Carbon Sinks</strong>
        Forests and oceans are called "Carbon Sinks" because they absorb more carbon than they release. They help keep our planet cool!
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Nitrogen Cycle</h2>
    Nitrogen is a crucial <strong>nutrient</strong> for all living things. It's a key part of DNA and proteins. Even though 78% of the air is nitrogen gas (N₂), most living things can't use it directly!

    <h3>Making Nitrogen Usable</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Nitrogen Fixation:</strong> Special bacteria in the soil (and on roots of some plants like beans) turn nitrogen gas into a form plants can use.
            <div class="vocabulary">This is the most critical step! Without these bacteria, plants couldn't grow.</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assimilation:</strong> Plants take up nitrogen through their roots. Animals get nitrogen by eating plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Decomposers return nitrogen to the soil from waste and dead organisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Denitrification:</strong> Other bacteria turn nitrogen in the soil back into gas, completing the cycle.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Modeling Nutrient Cycles in Cell Collective</h2>
    Understanding cycles is easier when you can see them in action. Let's model them!

    <h3>Building a Cycle Model</h3>
    In Cell Collective, you can create a model that shows how matter moves between different reservoirs.

    <strong>Key Components:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nodes (Circles):</strong> Represent the reservoirs (e.g., Atmosphere, Soil, Plants, Animals).</li>
        <li><strong>Edges (Arrows):</strong> Represent the processes that move matter (e.g., Photosynthesis, Eating, Decomposition).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions to Explore with Your Model</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What happens if you remove the decomposers from your ecosystem model?</li>
        <li>How does cutting down forests affect the carbon cycle?</li>
        <li>What happens if you add too much fertilizer (nitrogen) to the soil?</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Systems Thinking Tip:</strong>
        Cycles are closed loops. A change in one part of the cycle affects EVERYTHING else in the loop.
