          "title": "What is an Ecosystem?",
          "content": "An <strong>ecosystem</strong> is a community of living things (like plants and animals) interacting with non-living things (like water, soil, and sunlight) in a specific area. Think of it as nature's version of a system!\n\n<h3>Components of an Ecosystem</h3>\n\n<strong>Biotic (Living) Components:</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Plants that make their own food using sunlight (photosynthesis)</li>\n  <li><strong>Consumers:</strong> Animals that eat other organisms\n    <ul>\n      <li>Herbivores (plant-eaters like deer)</li>\n      <li>Carnivores (meat-eaters like wolves)</li>\n      <li>Omnivores (eat both, like bears)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> Organisms that break down dead material (bacteria, fungi, worms)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Abiotic (Non-living) Components:</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>Sunlight</li>\n  <li>Water</li>\n  <li>Soil</li>\n  <li>Air</li>\n  <li>Temperature</li>\n  <li>Rocks and minerals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<strong>Think About It!</strong> In a forest ecosystem, trees are producers, deer are consumers, and mushrooms are decomposers.

          "content": "Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction—from the sun to producers to consumers to decomposers.\n\n<h3>Food Chains</h3>\n\nA <strong>food chain</strong> shows how energy moves from one organism to another:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; font-size: 16pt;\">\nSun → Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Hawk\n</div>\n\n<h3>Food Webs</h3>\n\nReal ecosystems are more complex than simple chains. A <strong>food web</strong> shows multiple interconnected food chains. Most animals eat more than one thing!\n\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<strong>Example:</strong> A hawk might eat:\n<ul>\n  <li>Snakes (which eat frogs, which eat grasshoppers)</li>\n  <li>Mice (which eat seeds)</li>\n  <li>Rabbits (which eat grass)</li>\n</ul>\nAll these connections form a food web!\n</div>\n\n<h3>Energy Pyramids</h3>\n\nNot all energy transfers from one level to the next. Only about 10% of energy moves up each level!\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Bottom:</strong> Producers (most energy)</li>\n  <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Primary consumers (herbivores)</li>\n  <li><strong>Top:</strong> Secondary and tertiary consumers (carnivores)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"vocabulary\">\n<strong class=\"vocabulary-term\">Trophic Level:</strong> Each step in a food chain or food web\n</div>"

          "content": "Ecosystems naturally balance themselves through interactions between organisms. When one part changes, it affects everything else!\n\n<h3>Predator-Prey Relationships</h3>\n\nPredators and prey populations rise and fall together:\n<ul>\n  <li>More prey → More food for predators → Predator population increases</li>\n  <li>More predators → More prey eaten → Prey population decreases</li>\n  <li>Less prey → Less food for predators → Predator population decreases</li>\n  <li>Fewer predators → Prey population recovers → Cycle repeats</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<strong>Real-World Example:</strong> In Yellowstone National Park, when wolves were removed in 1926, deer populations exploded. They overate plants, causing erosion. When wolves were reintroduced in 1995, the ecosystem began to balance again!\n</div>\n\n<h3>Symbiotic Relationships</h3>\n\nSometimes organisms have special relationships:\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Mutualism:</strong> Both organisms benefit\n    <ul><li>Example: Bees get nectar from flowers; flowers get pollinated</li></ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Commensalism:</strong> One benefits, the other isn't affected\n    <ul><li>Example: Birds nest in trees; trees aren't helped or harmed</li></ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Parasitism:</strong> One benefits, the other is harmed\n    <ul><li>Example: Ticks feed on deer; deer lose blood</li></ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>"
